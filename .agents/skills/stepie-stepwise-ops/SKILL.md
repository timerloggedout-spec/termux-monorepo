# Stepie / StepWise ops

Stepie is the planning surface only. It does not confer merge authority.

Promotion still requires current-SHA dual-gate (repo-gate + termux-smoke) plus task-outcome evidence. Vercel is non-gate (#772).

## Session 2026-09-28 17:15 PDT

- Live master `8daeeb72d71ecdefa2f9cde6698426131117e474`.
- Dual-gate PASS 36497249095 / 36497249115.
- Planning only. No merge authority from this surface.
- Next plan: promote #899 after rebase + dual-gate on the new candidate SHA.
- #903 HOLD. Do not pulse #175. #184 names-only.

Session 2026-10-01 13:14 PDT / 2026-10-01 20:14 UTC:
- Master tip at session start `478949af307f8ed83fe09afe26bbb21f2d3894cd` (catalog refresh after #973).
- #973 merged at `ffb39b22fa29155de1f95fce55899403a7adbb7a`. #964 closed on that evidence. Zero-job filename failures did not recur on the merge SHA.
- Remaining push failure on ffb39b22 was Historical Evaluation Correlation run 36914069529 (catalog --check race). Repair branch fix/historical-correlation-catalog-race. Do not promote until that SHA has no correlate failure from catalog drift.
- Vercel rate-limit is noise. #903 HOLD. Do not pulse #175. #184 names-only. Linear TER-15 / TER-71 still In Progress — not promote authority.


Session 2026-10-02 15:21 PDT / 2026-10-02 22:21 UTC:
- Master tip at session start `20cfd74ea7f99a664098d695f808756409fd6e3b`.
- Active failure class: push of ancestor `0b135032108bc0cb5ceda8a62cc1f2638fcf55f5` onto master produced zero-job filename failures (ci-sweep 37071088656, swe-reference 37071087430, agent-jules 37071086431, actions-run-watcher 37071085454, fix-on-failure 37071084658, context-relationship-backfill 37071083955). Actor timerloggedout-spec. Tip remained `20cfd74e`. Not a current-tree YAML regression.
- Ruleset `master-no-rewind` id 24394235 active: deletion and non_fast_forward, no bypass actors.
- #996 merged `57cbafa6b589d93309f690ea6194a1c0f65396c6`. Evidence on receipt `063547bbd9d01197c2b9e4eca20864a60b314aa2` (parent `fc4c1ce84b1377472833de421f1a72780e49da69`): repo gate 37071857211 success, termux smoke 37071857224 success, development evaluation 37071857133 success. Parent repo gate 37071836003 success, termux smoke 37071835891 success, development evaluation 37071835865 success, historical promotion gate 37071835885 success, actionlint 37071835928 success, workflow surface policy 37071835907 success. Receipt action_required was bot approval, not a code failure. Post-merge push gates in progress at note time (repo gate 37072092071, termux smoke 37072092119).
- #984 not master. #903 HOLD. Do not pulse #175. #184 names-only. Linear TER-15 still In Progress — not promote authority.


Session 2026-10-02 20:14 PDT / 2026-10-03 03:14 UTC:
- Master tip at session start `c90727c83b63915a7656c3be3c901250fe7797ec` (sweep receipt after #1004 `830e11a9`).
- Post-merge n8n SHE bridge on `830e11a9`/`a61c089a`/`c90727c8` success (not zero-job). Repo gate 37089400164 success, termux smoke 37089400157 success, sweep 37091668135 success. Combined status failure is Vercel rate-limit only.
- Ancestor `0b135032` zero-job class is not current-tree. Hygiene-24h zero-job on feat/dashboard-lanes-v2 closed by #1003 on that base only.
- Active class: Sweep Accountability receipt non-fast-forward (run 37082734311). Repair branch `fix/sweep-receipt-non-ff-20261002`. Do not promote until that SHA has no filename-named workflow failure and repo gate is green.
- #984 not master. #903 HOLD. Do not pulse #175. #184 names-only. Linear TER-15 / TER-71 not promote authority.
