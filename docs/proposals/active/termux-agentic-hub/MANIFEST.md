# MANIFEST — termux-agentic-hub

## Summary

Establish a Termux-first Agentic Hub for the BLU B160V by adding the approved user-owned MCP forks as reproducible submodules under `refTemplates/smods/`, implementing a single local policy hub and structured GitHub-backed job protocol, and extending CI with low-privilege integrity and validation workflows. The implementation keeps Android execution local, treats GitHub as the review and coordination plane, keeps direct interactive transport deferred, and excludes credentials, browser state, interactive MFA bypasses, and public device exposure.

## Review log

### 2026-08-15 — user

- Disposition: accepted
- Notes: Use `refTemplates/smods/` for fork submodules, preserve DeepSeek compatibility, remain on free/trial infrastructure, and treat the local Termux environment as the first execution target.

### 2026-08-15 — Manus

- Disposition: scope clarification
- Notes: Interactive MFA enrollment remains human-operated. Machine-to-machine integrations may use provider-supported service credentials only; no MFA bypass or second-factor secret capture is implemented.
